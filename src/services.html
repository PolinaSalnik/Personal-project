        <h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
        <div class="services_page_item_describtion">
          <p>From a simple, single-page presence to a massive multi-page website with custom applications, our design
            team
            can take your sketches or ideas and turn them into reality.</p>
          <p>Design is only one part of a bigger collaboration. What makes our website design process work is the
            diverse team of specialists assigned to each part of your project. At 360 PSG, our web designers are focused
            on delivering the best possible design for your site.

        <h2>CONTENT MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <div class="services_page_item_describtion">
          <p>We currently offer two content management solutions, the Fission Web System and 360 CMS. Both platforms
            were built in-house, and are constantly maintained and updated by our own development team. Our Account
            Managers will help you determine which one is right for you.
          </p>
          <p>Responsive design allows visitors to view your website in a manner that is optimized for the device they
            are
            using - meaning no pinching, zooming, or significant scrolling is needed in order to view the site. This is
            increasingly important in an era where mobile devices and tablets are the status quo. 56% of all cell phone
            owners use a Smartphone, while almost the same number of Americans own either an e-reader or tablet
            computer.
            According to some projections, mobile internet usage will overtake desktop computer usage before 2015.</p>

        <h2>CUSTOM PROGRAMMING</h2>
        <div class="services_page_item_describtion">
          <p>Our experienced team of programmers can build anything from simple website applications to large-scale
            programs that will revolutionize your industry, products, processes, or communications. If you can dream it,
            we can build it.
          </p>
          <p>Every project starts with a simple request for quote, based on your needs. Don't be afraid to send over a
            few
            bullet points (you can even fax us the napkin you scribbled your ideas on!) or attach a complex and formal
            RFP. Our developers will work with you to develop a solution that fits your needs, within a budget that
            works
            for you. Explore what it means to have a large, dedicated team focused on your custom applications!</p>

          <h2>E-COMMERCE SOLUTIONS</h2>
          <div class="services_page_item_describtion">
            <p>Our versatile e-commerce system can help you easily build catalogs with dynamic product photos,
              descriptions, and categories. You can also accept payment for items that might not fit a traditional
              catalog
              format, such as online reservations, membership fees, event registrations, rent payments, and more!
            </p>
            <p>With custom add-ons, you also can sell unique items that might not fit a traditional catalog format, such
              as
              online reservations, deposits, memberships, registrations, rent payments and more!
              However, Fission Commerce is more than a simple sales processing tool. When used strategically, it can
              help
              drive sales through your website. Instead of simply pointing visitors to a sales catalog page, Fission
              Commerce can also be incorporated throughout your company's entire website, to highlight related products,
              feature products on specific pages, or promote special deals or sales.</p>
